    "Flexible Decision Boundary: Unlike linear classifiers like Logistic Regression or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), QDA can model non-linear decision boundaries between classes. This flexibility allows QDA to capture more complex relationships in the data.\n",

This can be beneficial when the classes have different variances or when the relationship between features and classes is complex.\n",
